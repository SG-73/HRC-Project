# HRC Project – AI-Enabled FinTech Invoice Management

### Overview
This project was developed as part of my Tech Internship at HighRadius. It focuses on building a Machine Learning model to predict the Order Amount (in USD) that customers are likely to place in upcoming days. The goal was to enhance cash flow forecasting and assist in data-driven credit decisions for B2B clients.

### Problem Statement
Businesses often face challenges in estimating future order volumes due to inconsistent payment histories and fluctuating market demands. This project aims to forecast customer order amounts using historical invoice and transaction data.

### Tools & Technologies
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Model Used:** Linear Regression & Random Forest Regressor

### Approach
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Derived meaningful attributes (e.g., average payment delay, invoice frequency).
3. **Model Training & Evaluation:** Trained regression models and compared accuracy metrics.
4. **Prediction & Visualization:** Predicted future order amounts and visualized trends.

### Results
- Achieved a reliable predictive accuracy with minimal error margin.
- Improved invoice forecasting efficiency and supported business decision-making through data insights.

### My Contribution
- Designed and implemented the end-to-end ML pipeline – from data ingestion to prediction.
- Performed feature selection and model tuning to optimize accuracy.
- Created visualizations to highlight prediction trends and insights.
- Documented the workflow and results for internal review and future scalability.
